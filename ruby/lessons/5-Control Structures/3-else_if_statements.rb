# Else If Statements

# Reminder of what we did the last lesson.

if car_speed < speed_limit
  puts "You are under the speed limit!"
else
  puts "You are speeding! Slow down!"
end

# What happens if the car_speed is equal to 
# the speed_limit? How can we account for that?



# Create your own elsif statement using the current
# year and your graduation year as variables.
