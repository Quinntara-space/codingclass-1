# Comparing Strings

# See what happens in the following comparisons:

puts "a" > "b"
puts "a" > "A"

# In strings, each letter is given a corresponding
# number, which you can find by calling the method
# .ord



# For a string of multiple letters, the comparison
# is done for each letter in the string, until false
# is arrived, otherwise true
