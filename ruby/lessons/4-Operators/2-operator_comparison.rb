# Let's say we have the following two variables:

a = 8
b = 10
c = 12

# We can ask if they are equal by using ()



# We can ask if they are not equal by using ()



# We can ask for less than or greater than with (<, >)



# And likewise for less than or equal to 
# or greater than or equal to with (<=, >=)
