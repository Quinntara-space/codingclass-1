# Methods

# Methods are similar to functions in other
# programming languages

# We start with def, which means define, then
# the name of the method

def add
  
end

# We can also pass in arguments with any
# name we want.

def add(a,b)
  
end

# We can also return values from a method
def add_with_message(a, b)
  
end



# What happens if you don't pass in all the
# arguments? Try it.
