# Adding Strings

# Define your names
first_name = "Mr."
last_name = "Barrette"

# Create a variable full_name that 
# joins first_name and last name.
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
puts full_name

# Now create a variable for age:
age = 21

# Join your age to the end of your string
# and print it to the screen.
puts "Hello my name is #{full_name} and my age is #{age}"
puts full_name + "," + age.to_s

# What happens? Why?
