# Adding Strings

# Define your names
first_name = "Mr."
last_name = "Barrette"

# Create a variable full_name that 
# joins first_name and last name.

puts full_name = first_name + last_name

# Now create a variable for age:

age = 18

# Join your age to the end of your string
# and print it to the screen.
puts full_name + age

# What happens? Why?
