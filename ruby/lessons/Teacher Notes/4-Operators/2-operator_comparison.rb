# Let's say we have the following two variables:

a = 8
b = 10
c = 12

# We can ask if they are equal by using (==)

puts a == 8
puts a == b
puts a == "a"

# We can ask if they are not equal by using (!=)

puts a != 8
puts a != b
puts a != "a"

# We can ask for less than or greater than with (<, >)

puts a > a
puts a > b
puts a < b

# And likewise for less than or equal to 
# or greater than or equal to with (<=, >=)

puts a >= a
puts a >= b
puts a <= b
